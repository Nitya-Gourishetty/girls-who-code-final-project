  Hi and welcome to my website! I am Nitya Gourishetty, currently in Joaquin Miller Middle School, 6th grade.
I have made this website totally out of code, which considering this is my first time with code, I am pretty 
impressed with it! Press on the tabs above to go to different pages. I know it's not a lot, but I hope you enjoy it!

Happy exploring, 
Nitya Gourishetty
