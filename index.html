  Hi and welcome to my website! I am Nitya Gourishetty, currently in Joaquin Miller Middle School, 6th grade. I have made this website 
totally out of code, which considering this is my first time with code, I am pretty impressed with! I know it's not a lot, but I hope
you enjoy it!

Happy exploring, 
Nitya Gourishetty
