  <h1 style="font-family:verdana">About Me:</h1>
  <p style="font-family:tahoma; font-size:160%">
    I'm 11 years old going to Miller Middle School in San Jose, California. In my family I have one older sister, Krishna Priya
    (16 years old), my mom, Kavitha, and my dad, GopiKrishna. My mom, dad, and sister were all born in India in a state called Telengana
    in South India as my mother-toungue language is Telugu. After school, I have a few extra-curricular activities that are swimming,
    dance, piano, and Telugu. In my free time, I often like to read and watch TV. I also have a school email:  nityagourishetty@gmail.com.
    I am a big foodie and I like try new foods all the time but I am also a chocolholic and my my fovorite type of chocolate is dark.
    If you were to ask me what is your favorite food, I would reply, "I don't know!" because I have alot and I wouldn't want to waste 
    your time on that. But also keep in mind that I am a vegetarian so I won't eat everything. Overall, I think I have a very blessed and 
    happy life.
